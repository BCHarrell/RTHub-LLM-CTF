This system is not to be abused.

This is a very serious matter. LLMs are expensive, we want to see your productivity increase 10x by using them... or else.

To interact with the LLM, ask it questions. Be truthful. Don't try to tell it you're an administrator if you're not.

Contact an administrator if you need help: son_of_anton, bgilfoyle, big_head
Note: big_head isn't the best if you have a security question...
